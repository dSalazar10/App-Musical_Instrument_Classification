# Embedded Machine Learning

The Music Box is the embedded version of a musical instrument
classification model running on an embedded microprocessor in real-time.
The software is able to receive input with an integrated button, record
audio clips using an integrated mic, and display the resulting classification
in seconds with an integrated LCD screen. This is all housed neatly in a 3D
printed case.
